### Project kick-off

Everything starts with business goals and priorities. To be effective, we want to have short-term and long-term goals. Nothing is written in stone and most likely during the development process. Before we start the development process, it is crucial:

<ul class="list-decoration list-decoration-column">
<li>To research similar solutions and competitors</li>
<li>Evaluate approximate timelines and general scope of work</li>
<li>Find out different solutions and different technologies</li>
<li>Build up a plan for the engineering team</li>
</ul>

### Building a team

We don't offer you any general solutions for everything. Quite the opposite, we create a team individually based on your needs and requirements.

To build a competitive product, we need to be on point. And to be on point, we need to have the right team combinations. When planning your business and archiving goals, we need to be precise in budgets, deadlines, and risk management. Incorrect team combinations increase the risks of failing to deliver on time or showing average results. 

We take these responsibilities from your shoulders and can be held accountable for this.
As a general example, we saw one common mistake when companies were trying to build a team of rock star engineers. Our statistics show that this team has a low chance of “getting things done.” You need to have different engineers with different levels and skills to deliver a product. While it's essential to have very experienced engineers, usually they are not interested in tedious work.

This means that you need to correctly estimate the type of future work and build a team based on that.

### Deliverables and timelines

Our primary goal is to create a high-level understanding of the scope, start recruiting engineers, and design 1-2 critical uses cases for the first few weeks.
Usually, the first couple weeks are focused on scope, the setup of the development environment and process (or integrating into the existing one), and recruiting the first engineers to start executing.

<ul class="list-decoration list-decoration-column">
<li>Set up devops infrastructure</li>
<li>Set up CI/CD processes</li>
<li>Set up admin panel</li>
<li>Compile a  list of the required engineers</li>
<li>Start working with user workflows and UX for the most important scenarios</li>
</ul>

### Proof of concept

Proof of concept is the first step in product development and service design that lets you know whether you’re solving the right problem. Look for a proof of concept process that leverages short feedback cycles, enabling you to stay agile and quickly close the gaps between your expectations and the reality of your testing. In testing your proof concept, you'll be able to determine two important things:
a) whether people need your product and
b) what resources do you need to build it

We can deliver the first proof of concept in 2-3 months using our pre-build components. You will get a working prototype you can demo and a list of resources and timelines required to build an MVP product. We can start right from the MVP phase and skip proof of concept in some cases. 
Below you can find an optimistic flow of fintech software we developed:

But let's say we have this request:

<ul class="list-decoration">
<li>A Reg CF investment platform</li>
<li>Sign in, sign up functionality</li>
<li>Build up a plan for the engineering team</li>
<li>User dashboard</li>
<li>Ability to create new investment offers</li>
<li>Ability to invest using custody service (North Capital, Fund America, etc.)</li>
<li>Ability to manage an investment (cancel)</li>
<li>Email notifications</li>
</ul>

This will take approximately 3-5 months, including 1-2 months to build a team and execution plan

### MVP

Once you collect the first feedback from a prototype, the next step is to learn how people react to different iterations of your product and its potential features. Proof of concept shows how your product might look in practice, while MVP will help verify your product’s viability. The minimum viable product helps you learn how to build that product most sustainably, with the least effort. You’ll gain valuable insights into usability, market demand, and which features will satisfy your early adopters.

MVP is stable enough to test it on different groups of users. It’s an iterative process with the potential to lower development costs, even while helping you bring a product with more chance of success to market. The MVP process enables you to determine what your customers want precisely, so you can add only those features needed to make it marketable. The timeline for MVP may vary depending on the number of iterations and enhancements you want to do. Typically it takes **3-5 months** to find a market fit and combine technical, marketing and sales efforts.

### Product launch

Once you have an MVP out of the way, you’ll want to work your way through your pre-launch checklist and put systems in place for gathering impartial user feedback once you go live.
The only way to test all your assumptions - is to put your product in front of real users as quickly as possible. 
Product release usually comes with:<br>
`-` 70% test coverage: automatic and unit tests<br>
`-` Technically polish and detailed solution<br>
`-` Scalability, benchmark tests<br>
`-` Detail logging system to be able to track problems quickly<br>
The typical timeline is **4-6 months**

### Development process

This is a general description, and we will adjust the process based on what will work best for you.

We are fans of two weeks sprints and the agile development process. We use Kanban board and additional labels to track progress and ensure clear communication.
On every project, we have a very encouraging environment, and as a company, we do our best to put engineers in a comfortable state to deliver.
Anyone can talk with anyone. It's OK to raise a problem and ask for different ideas and solutions. In many cases, together, we are brainstorming and trying to figure out a path to move forward.
Below we covered basics of our sprint pipeline

### Sprint Pipeline

<ul class="list-decoration">
<li>Create a backlog with epics and user stories</li>
<li>Do initial prioritization of epic with Product Owner.</li>
<li>
We do regular backlog refinement with PM and engineers to keep the 
backlog up to date and ready for next sprints.
</li>
<li>Based on team velocity and estimates, we take tasks from the top of the Backlog to the Sprint.
</li>
<li>
Conduct daily standups to keep all team members up to date. For better transparency, engineers will post their progress in #progress_reports channel in Slack.
</li>
<li>
Two days prior to Sprint's end, we update stage environment and 
do code-freeze to perform manual and automated testing.</li>
<li>On the agreed day, we update production.</li>
</ul>

Our development process evolves with us but it is always based on the same fundamental values. Many successful integrations into engineering teams and building new teams prooves that there is always a path to a great product. And we are always eager to explore it and adopt best practices as we learn.
