When you start looking for a reliable outsourcing company for complex solutions in Fintech, Ecommerce or IoT, it’s good to know the difference between an average company and a good one. In our experience, the following issues might occur:

### No in-depth understanding of business logic and goals

Many outsourcing teams often focus on the technical side of the product rather than business logic. If that’s the case, you have to control the development of the product each step of the way to make sure your business goals are met.

### Speed over quality

Working on multiple projects simultaneously is a common practice and a necessity. The more projects there are the higher the profits. The speed of development is preferred over the complexity of the project which results in last-minute changes, insufficient pilot testing, and bugs. You may find some of them yourself or worse, it’s pointed out to you by users.

### Lack of personal approach

The developers involved in too many projects at a time keep breaking their promises due to work overload. Some projects, including yours, may suffer from a lack of attention to the details. As a result, the deadlines are not met and both business and product reputation are damaged.

### Tendency to oversell

It’s possible that you’ve already encountered companies who have a tendency to oversell and present their services as more complex and more expensive than they actually are. A simple project may turn out to be a long and money-draining ordeal, and you may end up paying much more for half the product you signed up for.

Considering all of the above, one can be discouraged to outsource any software development. But in many cases, developing a new product on your own is not an option. Nevertheless, when you are aware of the risks the chance of picking a reliable outsourcing company is much higher.
