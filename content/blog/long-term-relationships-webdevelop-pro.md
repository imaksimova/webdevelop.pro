Our priority at Webdevelop Pro is to partner with small teams for the long haul. 
It may sound cliché but truthfully, we’re at our best when we’re helping our 
partners grow over the long term, flexibly adapting to new business needs as 
the team and business scales. But there are a few crucial elements to any productive, 
long-term partnership, here are a few of the things we’ve learned along the way.

## Understand your partners’ business

Its crucial to understand your partners’ business, and equally importantly, 
the context of the wider industry that surrounds it. Any prospective team has 
a reason for discussing with you, its important to understand their challenges 
and the challenges typically faced by similar companies. How can we preemptively 
address these pain points? What separates your partners’ product or offering? 
What types of technology are frequently used by other companies, and what are 
their relative strengths and weaknesses? Some early research and a solid 
foundation will have outsize effects as the relationship progresses.

## Trust

Thorough research is a key factor in building a foundation trust with your partner. 
Any team is taking a gamble when they outsource any part of the development process, 
it is key that the relationship be rooted in a deep, mutual respect. Make sure 
you underpromise and overdeliver, never set unrealistic expectations that you cannot achieve. 
Get to know members of the other team and don’t be afraid to ask difficult questions.

## Communication

Both partners will benefit from an exchange of ideas, or by hearing a fresh perspective 
on an old problem. Open, transparent communication is a vital building block in building a 
functional and productive working relationship. Make sure you create an open channel of 
communication, who do you inform with an update? Respond quickly, and make sure 
both parties feel heard and their ideas considered.

## Provide Value

The clients goal is is to find products and services that add some type of value to their business. 
Small teams have a lot to lose and are risking a lot to partner with you. As you develop 
a strategy to build long-term partnerships, keep in mind what the average customer 
would hope to get out of such a relationship. Through your hard work, you can make 
connections that will add value to your partners’ businesses, which will in 
turn make them want to keep working with you.

We hope that any business relationship will bring you profit, peace of mind 
and a great experiences. If you have any more questions about how to build a 
profitable, long-term, partnership, feel free to reach out!
