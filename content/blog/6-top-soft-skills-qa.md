Not all skills needed to be a good QA are technical. In the long run, the lack of so-called
“soft” skills costs the team in general and QA engineer in particular more expensive than the
lack of technical knowledges. So what are the key soft skills you should develop to become
good QA Engineer?

## Willingness to learn and quick learning outcomes

I guess the first and the most important point does not need much explanation. But still good
to highlight that technology is changing every single day. New development
solutions/frameworks, new management methodologies, new testing strategies, new tools
always appear. And that’s thing which makes IT professions so fascinating. But this also
means that to be a professional you should never stop learning the latest tools and
continuously train yourself as QA.

## Know how to ask the right questions

It goes without saying that first days on a new project is difficult and overwhelmed. You are
expected to understand the requirements and the logic of product functionality in short
terms.<br>
So it is absolutely important thing to be able to clarify all inaccuracies your met during first
exploratory testing, understand meaning of all terminology used in a team, find out how
processes are built, etc. Some of these points could not be solved by yourself only and you
need to ask your team-mates.<br>
At the same time it is worth remembering that everyone has own tasks and does not have
much time to answer poorly defined and indistinct questions. So your questions should be
clear, prioritized and polite.

## Know how to listen

This point is related to the previous one. Along with asking questions you should be able to
listen without interrupting, hear, heed and understand what your colleagues
mean/need/highlight. Listening ability helps to build effective communication, clearly
understand requests, avoid re-asking and tickets ping-pong, detect and even prevent
problems.

## Personal time management and task prioritization

QA engineer are often expected to perform the most urgent tasks implementation of which
can cause neglection other tasks that need to be also fulfilled. Another case - tasks can be
endless but still must be completed. Keeping yourself organized and ability to set priorities in
correct way help work efficiently and reach success in tasks solving.

## Critical Thinking

For QA Engineer critical thinking is super important. Desire to figure out the root of the
problem is usually highly valued. Moreover you should be ready to argue and defend your
opinion but remember that you should be flexible enough to drop it if business needs

## Ability to express thoughts/requests in plain language

During formulating of problem statements, test cases, task definitions you should always use
clear unambiguous and wordings. They should be detailed, but should not have redundant
information. This skill helps to create useful, easy to understand and navigate documentation
and also to avoid misunderstanding and loss or distort of information.
