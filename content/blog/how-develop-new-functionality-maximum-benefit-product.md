The main stakeholders for any functionality being developed are the business side (or
product owner), UX designer, developer, and QA engineer. These 4 sides represent the
point of view of what the system should do, how it should look, what can and can not be
implemented, and what may go wrong or be missed. Having different people for each point
of view will help reduce missing important points.

And yet, do not limit discussion with only these sides. Depending on the functionality you are
developing, you may find that other interested parties are needed to provide other points of
view (marketing team, seo-specialist, support team, etc). But do not think that the bigger is
the better. Include only people who are interested and will be involved in the implementation
process. Do not include the whole team in discussion as this reduce team membersâ€™ sense
of responsibility. As a result of passive participation - important points may be missed.
Placing the right people in discussion is must done to achieve the best results.
How get things done?

These nominal four parties must work together to determine what needs to be done, how to
understand that it is done and done as expected. Once the functionality is implemented,
each party should check the final result to make sure that it is still correct from the point of
each view.

The first discussion should be immediately before user story implementation. Do not wait too
late to add details and ask questions because the delay will slow development down. Do not
start discussion too early - the details may become outdated, the context may change so
that knowledge can no longer be applied.

Between the beginning and the end all key participants should communicate closely, so that
any misunderstandings be discovered and corrected at an early stage and therefore any
new ideas can be included. By continuous sharing the different perspectives on the
functionality everyone can raise their concerns and resolve as soon as possible.

### Why is it important?

This approach helps to avoid:

- missing any details
- confusion in user story understanding
- rework

### What can be difficult?

- incorrect or incomplete workgroup composition. Members should be carefully considered.
- too frequent discussions - instead of implementation. Discussion should be
qualitative and detailed to resolve most of the questions before implementation is
started.

In general these user stories discussions are short workshop with the team to understand
the details and ensure everyone has all the information they need. But in the end it gives
great value to the product.
