In addition, the company has a tradiional problem of growing, building relations with customers and were actively looking for engineers, designers, data scientists, and quality engineers.

## Solution

At first, we split our resources based on priorities and company goals. Relatively quickly we manage to set up google dataflow jobs to build bitcoin and ethereum blockchain ledger parser and saved all the data into postgresql and bigquery storages. Using google cloud AI tools (deep learning VM images, data labeling services, AI Hub) data scientists we able to process raw transactions and build prediction models. Partnership with different exchanges helped us to retrieve vital data set to deanonymize and label wallets with concrete identifies.

## Results

By building analyzer tool for bitcoin ledger company attracted different venture capitals: Pantera, foundation capital, aspect venture, digital currency group. This provides critical connections to get data sets to work with wallet identifies and funds prediction after mixers. While those tasks arenâ€™t possible to solve 100% correctly the company was successful enough to be bought by a big player on the market
