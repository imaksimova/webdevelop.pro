## Challenges

Marketing research showed that it was very expensive to acquire a new customer and with existing, stable and well-funded competitors, they donâ€™t have enough budget to get critical amounts of the users to become profitable. In order to survive the company decided to change its marketing strategy and use a loyal user base to attract new users. The marketing team developed a unique reward program and decided to build a custom affiliate software to fulfill their need. Another challenge was the quality of their existing solution.

Previously, their platform was compiled from different companies and people from Upwork and other freelances websites. Certain freelance resources were no longer in place, others were pretty hostile for new engineers. The company was lucky to be able to deliver the product to the market but codebase was too fragile to do any sort of developments

## Solution

Firstly, it was important to understand the core company business and create testing documentation and workflows. Secondly, we successfully created test environments and pipelines so that all developers were able to work simultaneously on different tasks. Afterwards, we spent time on codebase research and understanding how we can integrate the existing software with an affiliate platform company asked for. During our research, we provided a detailed report and finalized our proposal about additional steps that were needed to be taken in order to perform an integration.

## Results

We built strong and long business relations with a Client. At first, we introduced a stable and productive ready workflows for software development, product releases, and quality assurance processes to identify problems before they happen on production. Gradually, we managed to build required affiliate solutions and perform seamless integration with an existing product. In fact, it took longer than expected to integrate the new product with an existing solution. However, at the end, the Client was satisfied to receive a stable and reliable product.
