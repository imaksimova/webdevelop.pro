  text: For a company in its early stages or a new startup we recommend replacing DevOps, 
    Quality Assurance Engineer, and project manager with an extra frontend engineer. 
    More established startups should have a full-time DevOps, QA engineer,
    and a Project Manager. Adding an extra Designer and a Frontend engineer 
    is also a good idea. We value transparency and direct communication 
    with our customers. We can set up 2-4 weeks long business 
    trips for our development team to come to your office twice a year.

      text: "<p>UI/UX design plays an essential role in successful software development. 
        To achieve great product usability we need to link business requirements and technical processes together. 
        That’s what UI/UX design is for. The process of designing a product starts with extensive research. 
        Thorough research is the key to creating a product that will be attractive to customers and easy to use. 
        The next stage is wireframing. At this stage, we create the layout of product design. 
        Next step is creating a prototype. When it’s done we are ready to test the product. 
        Finally, we create a user interface. Product design is refined throughout the whole process until it’s 
        ready to be presented to the customer.</p><p><strong>We always strive to create the best product for the end-user.</strong> User stories are an important part of our design process. 
        User stories help us organize and prioritize our goals and keep us user-focused. 
        Our main objective is to deliver the product with the best possible design for our target audience. 
        We believe that design-driven development is the way to achieve this goal.</p>"

## Our perspective

It is a real challenge to find a software engineer with necessary requirements, 
and it's even a bigger challenge to find an experienced developer in a specific field. 
You are probably looking for someone capable of doing a good job, with a
positive attitude, and a particular skill set for your project. 
Then, there are budget and time limits to deliver it. All this 
responsibility creates a huge amount of pressure on the person in charge. 
Here's where we come in. Our objective is to remove this pressure from 
you and deliver a successful product. Our approach is simple but effective. 
Here is why we can give you a high-quality product guarantee:

### With over 1000+ engineers in our network, we can find top-notch professionals for your project

We have 10+ years of experience in software development. 
During this time we have delivered plenty of successful projects and 
became acquainted with many professional developers in all kinds of fields. 
We work on projects of various complexity
every day, and we will be happy to help you create the best product for your target audience.

### Choice of the technology stack

Our choice of tech stack is based on vast experience in using various kinds of 
software development tools. Also we’ve developed an extensive set of libraries 
and frameworks of our own and we constantly improve it by implementing new technologies.
Including reusable tech components saves time, speeds up the development 
process and helps us build maintainable products.

### Our teamwork practices

To create successful and profitable products and to build effective 
development teams is equally important to us. Some of our teamwork 
practices were adopted from the Agile approach. We respond to changes 
in project requirements quickly and effectively. We value our 
customers’ feedback and communicate with them constantly. 
We are eager to learn new technologies, and sharing 
knowledge with each other empowers our team collaboration. 
We value interaction and motivation in our team, and we believe 
it contributes greatly to creating great products.

### Money-back guarantee

A satisfaction guarantee is one of the most important points for a customer. 
Our work doesn't stop once we've built a team for you. We’re monitoring the 
whole development process from the stage of understanding product 
requirements to launch. If a team member fails to deliver their task we 
take full responsibility for it. If you are not satisfied with 
the delivered product we give you your money back.
