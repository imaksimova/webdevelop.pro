postDescription: >
  The point of building a minimum viable product or an MVP is to test a product's idea. 
  This option is especially good for startups as it can reduce financial risks, 
  evaluate product viability and analyze users' feedback in a shorter time and at a reduced cost. 
  The data gathered from launching an MVP shows what improvements are required to create a 
  successful product. With our <a href="/startup-dev-kit">Startup devkit</a>, we can build a robust and scalable MVP in 4-6 months.

      We want to understand your idea in as much detail as possible. 
      Is it a product or a service? What are its goals? Who is your 
      target audience? How is this product is going to be useful to them? 
      What problems does it solve? The more we can learn about your idea, the better we can implement it.

      The competition in the software development industry is very high. 
      To create a successful product you should know your potential customers, 
      the market and the competitors offering a similar product or a service. 
      Research can give you an insight into a better presentation of your idea.

      Now that the idea of the product is clear, we create an MVP development plan. 
      We describe how everything is going to work. How exactly a user is going to 
      interact with the product? What steps do they have to complete to 
      benefit from the service? What features does the product have?

      We need to visualize each step of a user's interaction with the product. 
      Our purpose is to create a simple and easy-to-use application. 
      To do that we focus on making the user experience a good one. 
      The next step is to list all product features and prioritize them. 
      There's no need to implement all features at once, just those 
      essential for the product to achieve its goals. We select the 
      tech stack based on the list of product's features. Once we've 
      laid the groundwork, we are ready to build an MVP.

      We start by creating a prototype. A prototype is a graphic 
      presentation of the product that is necessary for developers 
      to work out processes and details of the future MVP. 
      Building an MVP is just like building any software 
      product, you need a development team to do it.

      Assembling development teams has always been a passion of Webdevelop Pro. 
      We believe that the best result is achieved by a well-balanced 
      development team with a specific skill set required by a 
      project at hand. A <a href="/our-approach">well-balanced team</a> consists of:

      In our experience, UX/UI design is the foundation of a good MVP. 
      We keep it simple and develop only key features. A front-end engineer's 
      job is to implement visual and interactive elements. To bring our MVP 
      to life is the job of a back-end engineer, who is responsible for 
      the server-side of MVP development. A DevOps engineer ensures scalability, 
      stability, and security of an MVP. The last but not the least is 
      Quality Assurance and testing. A QA engineer identifies bugs and 
      potential problems, plans and performs tests during the development 
      process and recommends what improvements should be made. 
      As a result of the dev team's work, you get an MVP ready for launch.

      All that is left is to launch the MVP, monitor users' 
      feedback and decide where to go from there. There are 
      many web analytics tools that can help you evaluate 
      your MVP's performance and develop a marketing strategy to improve it.

## Build an MVP with Webdevelop Pro devkit

Let's say you have an idea for a software product that you would like to 
implement but your resources are limited. The development of a 
website or an application is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor.

So what can be done to test this new idea? The answer is to build a minimum 
viable product or an MVP. An MVP is a basic implementation of an idea that 
has just enough features and functionality to show potential users what 
it can do. MVP development is a necessary step to learn how to improve the end product.

Whichever the case, a quick product launch or a new product 
development Webdevelop Pro can build an MVP for your needs.

### Necessary steps
