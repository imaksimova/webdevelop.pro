      Today, NLP plays a huge part in chatbot development. 
      NLP technology enables chatbots to understand voice 
      messages and texts and give an appropriate reply. 
      Our engineers are skilled in developing sophisticated 
      and intelligent chatbots. We can train a bot to 
      understand your business specifics and improve 
      communication and client experience. We have 
      extensive knowledge of ready to use models, frameworks, 
      APIs, and techniques for various use-cases.

      AI can easily identify an object in an image or a video file and 
      many applications of image processing like, for example, 
      face recognition, are a part of our everyday life. 
      With our expertise in using powerful tools and cutting 
      edge technologies like Nvidia cards and Google's 
      Cloud Video Intelligence API, we can develop new 
      learning algorithms and build custom solutions for video and image processing.

      NLP is a field of artificial intelligence. Natural 
      language processing is the ability of a software 
      program to understand natural human language. 
      Numerous applications of NLP technology like 
      chatbots for customer support, data and text 
      analysis, email filters, search results, and 
      many others enable business growth and improve our lives. 
      With the help of tools and libraries for NLP, 
      we can set algorithms that work with big volumes 
      of data and deliver meaningful information to the end-user.

Nowadays, it’s hard to find an industry that hasn't been modified by 
Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML). They are 
the driving force for traditional businesses to gain more market share, 
increase revenue, improve customer experience, and decrease operating costs. 
If you want to explore these new technologies to enhance your business or 
optimize your business processes, we can provide you with production-ready innovative AI/ML solutions.

## How we create AI/ML solutions

These steps are required to create a (general) AI/ML solution:

- Data collection and organization. Extract insights, filter noise data and transcode existing data into a workable format.
- Creating or choosing a prediction model, creating a training set, which will be used to train the model.
- Splitting training set data and test set to check prediction model results.
- Creating a validation data set, which will be used to test, adjust and optimize your prediction model.
- Checking model on a set of real data, which haven’t been used for training.

## Exclusive ML solution for your platform

Webdevelop pro can build high-performance machine learning dataset and 
adaptive algorithms from scratch. Our engineers transform raw data 
from legacy software into clean datasets. We can integrate machine 
learning models for video, image or voice recognition into your 
business to conduct market research, optimize pricing, 
improve content recommendations and user experience.
These steps are required to create an AI/ML solution:

- Collect and organize data. Extract insights, filter out noise data and transcode existing data into a workable format;
- Select or create a prediction model, a training set which will be used to train the model;
- Split training set data and test set to check prediction model results;
- Create a validation data set which will be used to test, adjust and optimize prediction model;
- Test model on a set of real data that haven’t been used for training.
