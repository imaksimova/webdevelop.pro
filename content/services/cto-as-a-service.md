  <ul><li>you have an idea for a new product but you don't know how to implement it;</li>
  <li>you have a big ongoing project and your in-house expertise is not enough to proceed;</li>
  <li>you need an outside expert to coach your in-house team on new technology trends;</li>
  <li>your in-house team needs help in organizing their workflow;</li>
  <li>you don't need a full-time CTO at the moment, but you still need someone to give you advice on technologies</li></ul>

      So, does your company require a full-time CTO? It depends on what your company does. 
      If your business is deeply connected with software development the answer is definitely yes. 
      A specialist who can make the right choices about technologies and development 
      strategies can speed up the development process and put a company in front of 
      the competitors. A company whose business depends on software products faces 
      many technical challenges. For example, one of the biggest challenges in 
      creating a successful product is to select the right tech stack to 
      fit its requirements. That's one of many things a CTO knows how to do.

      The use of cutting edge technologies might be a huge advantage for a company, 
      but it can also have a negative effect. Imagine a scenario where an in-house 
      team decides to try out new technology without conducting proper research first. 
      Even a tech-savvy person can't know all about the latest technological innovations. 
      A company spends a lot of time searching for people who know how to work this 
      new technology and risks hiring people who lack the necessary skills.
      The point of using new technology is to strengthen the business and achieve the 
      company's business goals. Using a trendy technology just for show is not productive. 
      A CTO is well aware of what the company's in-house team is capable of and whether 
      trying out a new tech is worth the risk. A CTO makes sure that new 
      technologies are used efficiently and securely.

## What is a CTO

A CTO or a Chief Technical Officer is the person responsible for 
the technological side of a business or a project. 
A CTO is in charge of managing software development 
projects, technological partners, strategic innovation, 
IT support, managing and mentoring the development 
team and other matters that require technical expertise.

## A CTO's role in a software development company

A CTO’s role is very important in any company, but for a company working in software development, it's vital.
There are many things a CTO's expertise is required for:

- Managing software development processes and workflows;
- Developing a technology strategy and managing the company's technological assets;
- Managing sponsorships and partnerships. The bigger the company's goals are, 
  the more resources it needs. A software development company often 
  uses third-party services like cloud services or payment systems. 
  A CTO knows which services a company needs and how to manage 
  these matters in the way that benefits the company most;
- Managing the development team, mentoring and recruiting new developers. 
  This is is one of the most important tasks of a CTO. A strong 
  development team capable of creating successful products 
  is a powerful asset ensuring business growth;
- Designing software architecture and selecting the right tech stack;
- Software products' quality. A CTO is responsible for the quality 
  of the product that goes to the market and becomes available 
  to the end-user. It's a challenging task that requires 
  making difficult decisions like spending more time on 
  testing or speedy delivery of the new functionality requested by the investors;
- Writing software documentation;
- Ensuring the company's data security.

The list of CTO's responsibilities varies from company to company. 
A CTO in an established company and a CTO in a startup are 
two different job descriptions, but the core responsibilities are the same for any tech company.

## Test Other responsibilities of a CTO include:

- how to improve the company's infrastructure
- what latest technologies are available on the market
- making decisions about third-party providers services
- what specialists the company's development team needs
- making decisions whether it's better to create or obtain a new software product or a solution

A CTO solves all kinds of technical matters and makes sure that the development team has all the means to achieve company's business goals.

### CTO as a Service

CTO as a Service is especially beneficial for small companies and startups. 
They can hire a skilled professional with technological perspective to get 
them up to speed in the complex world of modern technology and help 
them avoid common pitfalls building the IT side of business.

Medium-size companies tend to use this service when they want to launch a new product.
