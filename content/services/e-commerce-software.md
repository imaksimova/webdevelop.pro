## Ecommerce software

10 years ago e-commerce software development was mostly focused on 
simplifying the process of online shopping and building friendly 
user interfaces to encourage customers to buy more products. 
Nowadays, it is a huge and complex market containing digital 
businesses selling products and services all over the world 
that has irrevocably transformed traditional shopping. 
Ecommerce software is the driving force behind any online store. 
An e-commerce platform is used to sell goods online, 
manage inventory, add or remove products, calculate taxes, and so on.

## Types of Ecommerce Software

We have worked on various e-commerce products for small, 
medium and large businesses. Each product we build has 
its unique goals and requirements. There are a few 
types of e-commerce software. You should consider 
these options to see which one is the right one for your business.

## White-label solutions

A white-label product is a fully supported product or a service produced 
by one company and sold by another. A reseller company purchases this 
product without branding and can customize it to make it look like 
theyâ€™ve produced it. Let's say you are a business owner in need of a new product. 
You have several options. You can develop a product from scratch. 
If you have a lot of time and money on your hands it can be a great option. 
You can [build a minimum viable product or an MVP](/services/build-mvp-webdevelop-pro-devkit). 
This option is good for a startup. But what if you need a new product to be on the market 
in a couple of weeks? You can purchase a white-label product, 
add custom design and functionality to it and launch it in no time.

Choosing a white-label solution over building a new one from scratch allows avoiding pitfalls like:

- Reinventing the wheel and getting stuck in the development process. 
  Spending too much time and money developing a product that is 
  already out there, and you could obtain it cheaper and launch it faster;
- Delaying product launch and increase downtime to get the product to the market. 
  A white-label product can be market-ready in a couple of weeks while developing a new product can take 6-10 months;
- Lack of resources and expertise required to create a new product or a service.

We launched white-label projects using various architecture and programming 
languages, and with every completed project we learn more. 
We would recommend the use of microservices architecture and a 
single-page application for white label solutions. This way 
the development process is faster and the budget is smaller.
