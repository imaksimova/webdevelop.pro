  IoT is a cutting edge technology impacting various industries like the oil and gas industry, digital manufacturing, energy, agriculture, cryptocurrency, and many others. Companies all over the world invest in the development of new IoT frameworks and products. The Internet of Things development is much more complex and challenging than traditional web development. The IoT software market has high standards for its products and development teams who build them. To build high-quality, scalable, robust, secure and user-friendly solutions a dev team has to bring their finest ideas to the table as well as reorganize their workflow.

  If you are searching for a development team to implement the latest IoT Technology 
  trends in your business you can rely on Webdevelop Pro. We have experience in 
  building applications that collect, share, analyze and predict events based on 
  the information provided by smart devices, sensors, and controllers. 
  Using various cloud providers we build robust, scalable and secure systems.

      Before starting the development process, several technical factors should be considered. 
      Unlike traditional computer systems, IoT devices are far less powerful and 
      have fewer system resources. The dev team has to evaluate IoT devices 
      they selected to work with and choose an operating system accordingly. 
      It should fit the requirements and devices’ capabilities.

      Choosing the right protocol is the key to success. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, serial ports, 
      Zigbee, and others have different energy profiles, advantages, and disadvantages. 
      The security standards, the development strategy, and the whole software 
      infrastructure are defined by the selected protocol. There are plenty of 
      IoT related services and libraries to choose from. These instruments 
      help software developers test their ideas before going into production saving time and money.

      Projects with requirements so complicated that it makes sense to develop a 
      platform from scratch are rare. In 95% of all cases, there is no need to 
      reinvent the wheel. Cloud providers have ready solutions, you just need 
      to pick the one which fits your requirements. The cloud computing market 
      can be overwhelming, and it’s better to spend extra time to do thorough 
      research. At Webdevelop Pro we have experience working with AWS and Google 
      Cloud IoT applications and solutions. Though both options have advantages 
      and disadvantages, we find Google Cloud to be a more preferable choice 
      because of a better price and a larger set of features. Here is a 
      list of significant factors to consider when choosing a platform:

      IoT software development is a constantly changing industry. 
      Software developers have tough deadlines to meet along with 
      changes and tweaks that need to be applied during the development process. 
      To give it one's best in a fast-paced environment takes skills 
      and experience. We ensure the reliability and security of our 
      IoT solutions through QA testing. Users expect your product to 
      work as advertised, and skipping on testing and security can 
      affect the product's performance and thus your business.

    title: A User-Friendly Design

    text: >
      We believe that every IoT product should be design-driven 
      and have a simple yet powerful UI. An end-user is not interested 
      in all the technical details and edge cases. They want a 
      product that works and has a simple intuitive UI to set it 
      up the way they see fit. To ensure great performance and 
      positive user experience of any software is no trivial task. 
      Our expertise in using data virtualization tools and modifying 
      device configuration helps us find the balance between 
      the technological complexity and usability of our IoT solutions.

      IoT development implies working with various devices that 
      have different architectures, protocols and operations 
      systems. We create IoT software capable of encoding and 
      decoding all types of data in a complex environment 
      where various protocols and operating systems interact. 
      Webdevelop Pro can build a highly secure custom 
      platform with an easy-to-use and powerful UI for your business.

## Security

*“S" in IoT stands for Security*

As you can see, there’s no “S” in IoT. By definition, 
IoT systems contain numerous connected devices, giving those 
with malicious intent multiple targets to scan for vulnerabilities. 
All devices in a network must be adequately tested, or the entire system is threatened.

You might recall an incident in 2016 when AWS, Twitter, Spotify, and 
other services were disrupted as the result of a [major DDoS attack on Dyn](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/major-ddos-attack-on-dyn-disrupts-aws-twitter-spotify-and-more/). 
The root cause was defined as the availability of third party DNS service providers. 
A huge amount of vulnerable IoT devices were used to execute this attack. 
One can’t be too careful when it comes to applying security measures to IoT systems.

In our experience, security issues should be addressed and resolved 
during the process of product development, not after. 
Assuring security is a colossal challenge for developers working on IoT projects. 
The effectiveness of security measures depends mostly on 
how much effort and resources are put into it at the earliest stages of product development.

Here is a basic security measures checklist we apply to all our products:

- SSL/TLS encryption;
- Isolated VLA;
- Detached corporate VPN;
- Modern and updated anti-virus;
- End-user and machine-to-machine authentication;
- Vetted frameworks for web development and design;

This checklist is constantly updated and may vary according to the project at hand.
