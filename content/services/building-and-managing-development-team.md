      Before putting a development team together, we need to gather all the information about the project. 
      A dedicated development team is built according to the project requirements. 
      After that, we select the tech stack and define what skillset is required for the project.

      We are looking for professionals who are passionate about what they do and who are specialists 
      in their respective areas of expertise. We need our candidates to be team players eager to be 
      fully engaged in their work. At this stage, we filter out those candidates 
      who aren’t suitable for the project. We run preliminary interviews to check:

      The candidates have to prove the level of the skills they claim to have mastered. 
      We give them a thoroughly prepared tech assignment designed according to the project’s 
      technical challenges and/or the role in the team that the candidate is being recruited for. 
      Now they have to prove how good are they are at what they do. 
      The results are reviewed by our top in-house developers.

      It's no doubt that having great technical skills is essential, 
      but that's not all that we expect from our candidates. 
      We want to hire people who are comfortable working with others 
      and are comfortable to work with. We're looking for 
      specialists that constantly improve and develop their skills.

      Now that we have filled in all the gaps and gathered all the information we go through 
      it very carefully to select the best candidates. We talk to the candidates again 
      to make sure all of the requirements are met. It is our primary goal to find 
      professionals best suited for your project. We work with many top-notch web 
      engineers, designers, and testers. We can begin interviewing potential candidates 
      as soon as we receive your request. A development team is assembled within a few weeks. 
      If necessary, we are open to signing an NDA to learn more about your project.

      We monitor the process of product development from requirements gathering to launch. 
      Over the years we've learned the best practices to effectively manage a dedicated 
      development team. We adopted the basics of the Agile method and combined them with 
      our own experience. Here are the highlights of our approach to managing development teams:

      Daily meetings, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and systematic reports are standard 
      procedures that we follow at all times. A group channel for clients and everyone 
      working on the project is open 24/7. We use a staggering work schedule to equally 
      accommodate our clients and development teams. It's unlikely that every project 
      has a detailed plan for every possible change from the very beginning. A dedicated 
      development team model allows us to respond to tweaks and changes in the project 
      quickly and effectively. Managing a development team is a continuous process, 
      and we can always adjust the team to the project's needs.

      Managing risks is our top priority. We believe that using Agile methodology 
      provides us with means to identify, prioritize, manage, and control risks 
      throughout the process of product development. We assess the risks we might 
      encounter at the same time as we gather requirements. We also monitor risks 
      at the sprint level with a thorough analysis every 2 weeks.

Many companies choose a dedicated team model to build custom software. Among many benefits of a 
dedicated development team are reduced project cost, flexibility, and faster time-to-market. 
This model is especially beneficial for long-term large-scale projects, and that's the kind 
of projects we're good with. Webdevelop Pro has been designing custom software for over 
10 years and delivered plenty of projects. Here’s how we build a dedicated development team you can rely on.

## How we build a development team

To assemble an effective development team we need to understand your business idea and goals first. 
There is no need to go deep into the details but it's important to see the big picture to 
recognize potential challenges and assess the risks. We take responsibility for the whole 
process of building a team so you don't have to make decisions on every small detail unless 
requested otherwise. We establish a direct channel of communication to keep you 
informed on the progress each step of the way.

## Our recruiting process

Once challenges and goals are clear, its time to start looking for the right people. 
We have a very thorough recruiting process to provide you with a high-performance team.

## Conclusion

One of the advantages of a dedicated team is simple and transparent pricing. 
The dedicated team model allows you to cut your expenses on the recruitment. 
The cost of a dedicated team is formed exclusively for every project and depends 
on the project complexity and the skillset of the specialists involved in it.

If a dedicated team is what you need, Webdevelop Pro will be happy to provide 
you with the best IT specialists to build your product. We're looking forward to hear from you.
