    title: It all starts with an idea

    text: Every great project starts with an idea. Maybe you’ve been thinking 
      about it for a long time, or maybe this idea just leaped into your mind.  
      A good idea is worth sharing. Write it down on a paper, discuss it with your staff. 
      If you are having trouble with technology implementation in your 
      business, we’re here to help you with that. Run your idea by us, 
      and we will provide you with a cost and time-efficient way of turning it into a successful product.

    title: Project planning

    text: The more complex the idea is the more thorough implementation it requires. 
      We've been in the software development field for quite some time now, 
      and we've gained mastery in selecting suitable technologies and methods 
      for all kinds of projects. Turning your great idea into a product is not 
      an easy task. You need a detailed plan of implementation, a proper set of 
      methods and a deep understanding of strong and weak points of 
      different kinds of technology. We’re here to guide you through it all.

    title: Putting a team together

    text: To create a product you need a team. The team should be built in 
      accordance with the plan of implementation and methods of realization. 
      A group of most talented developers won’t become a great team without 
      cohesion. A cohesive team is a huge advantage especially in a 
      competitive field like software development. We can build a 
      high-performance team of motivated professionals exclusively for your product.

    title: Product prototype

    caption: [First Feedback, Proof of Concept, Product Presentation, Broad Perspective]
    text: The prototyping process is a vital stage in product development. 
      The data gathered at this point shows us if any improvements 
      are required to continue our work in the right direction. 
      Changing functionality or design at the prototype stage is 
      much easier and cost-effective than doing so later on. 
      In our practice, the prototype is delivered within 2-3 months.

    title: Launching an MVP

    caption: [Stable Core, Scalable MVP, Fail-Fast Succeed Sooner, Adjusting the goals]
    text: We have over 10 years of experience in software development, 
      during this time we have successfully delivered plenty of projects. 
      We’re aware of technical risks that may occur when creating an MVP, 
      and we’re able to predict and prevent most of them. 
      We can build a scalable MVP within 4-6 months.

    title: Building a Product
    img: images/how-we-work/illustration-6.svg
    caption: [Fine-tuning the Team, Updating Roadmap, Adjusting the Milestones, Product Development]
    text: Now that we have gathered all the feedback and 
      data necessary, comes the final stage of the product 
      development. At this stage, some team adjustments 
      might be required. Together we decide if there are 
      any features that should be added to the final 
      product. We’re just one step away from bringing 
      your brand-new product to the market and making it available to the customers.

    caption: [Clear Workflow, Meeting Customer Needs, Open Communication, Team Availability]
    text: We never choose speed over quality. We pay close attention 
      to details and we always keep the channel of communication 
      with our customers open. The key values of our approach 
      to software development are transparency and flexibility. 
      The members of our development team are always within your 
      reach, and you can speak directly to any of them. We will 
      keep you updated on the development progress at every stage. 
      We are open to your suggestions and will gladly answer 
      any questions you might have for us.
